# Sublify

**Shape your subconscious. Reclaim your mind.**

---

## 💡 Motivation

Every day, we’re bombarded by thousands of subliminal cues—ads, logos, feeds—all designed to influence us without our awareness. Corporations spend billions planting seeds of insecurity and desire directly into our subconscious.

I built **Sublify** to **flip the script**: instead of letting outside forces shape your mind, you can use the same psychological techniques for *your own* growth—empowering beliefs, personal goals, and positive self-talk.

## 🧠 Why It Works

### Ultra-Fast Brain Processing
MIT neuroscientists found the brain can recognize images in just **13ms**, far below conscious awareness.

### Subliminal Priming
Research shows subliminal exposure creates **lasting neural changes**:
- Neurons extract more info from repeated stimuli
- Greater sensitivity to “primed” content
- Improved recognition and processing efficiency

### Neuroplasticity & Repetition
Your brain rewires itself based on repeated patterns. Advertising exploits this; Sublify uses it to strengthen **positive neural pathways**.

### Breaking Negative Loops
Sublify interrupts unconscious negative self-talk and replaces it with empowering cues—shifting your internal dialogue over time.
